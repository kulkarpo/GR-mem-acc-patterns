Memory Leak Application
==============

This project contains a Cloud Foundry application, with a terrible memory leak. The intent is to test the resilience of a Cloud Foundry environment, such as Bluemix.

## Running this application

1. Download this project:

	git clone https://github.com/patrocinio/java-memory-leak

2. Push the application to your Cloud Foundry environment:

    cf push
    
3. Open the application log:

    cf logs application-name

4. Now the application will start leaking after you open the main web page. So in your browser, point to the application's URL  

5. Watch the log file showing the application allocating lots of memory and crashing

6. Stop the application

    cf stop application-name
