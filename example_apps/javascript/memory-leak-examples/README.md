# Memory Leak Examples [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-best-practices/memory-leak-examples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-best-practices/memory-leak-examples)

This is a simple training application to help you get comfortable finding memory leaks and fixing them in the context of an actual web application. While this application is an [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) app, there is little in this training that is specific to Ember and pre-requisite knowledge of Ember is not required in order to do any of the exercises provided.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer in order to get the application up and running and to work through the exercises:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)
* [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) (_optional_)

## Installation

Once you have the prerequisites setup on your machine, you can install this applications and its dependencies with the following commands:

* `git clone https://github.com/ember-best-practices/memory-leak-examples.git`
* `cd memory-leak-examples`
* `yarn install`*

*_Note: Yarn is used to ensure that dependencies (including nested dependencies) are locked to a specific version. You can use `npm install`, but the results of the exercises may vary._

## Exercises

After completing installation, jump into the [`exercises` directory](./exercises/exercise-0.md). From there, just read through the exercises in order and you should do just fine. Good luck!
